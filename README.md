# CSV-Stitcher
This is a little kit for us to splice two or more csv dataset
When we have two csv dataset, we want fix into one, we can use it
I used it for fix a Kaggle hand writting dataset and the MNIST dataset
We pass this code on Ubuntu18.04 and Windows10 Pro
When you use this code, you can put all of the csv that you want to fix into a folder, then copy the path to my code and change it
